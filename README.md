This can be used as a reference to ease developers into mathematical notation, showing some equations in code.

Motivation: Academic papers can be intimidating for self-taught graphics programmers. :)

### sigma

The big Greek "E" (Sigma) is for [Summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation). In other words: summing up some numbers.

![sigma](img/sigma1.png)

Here, `i=1` says to start at `1` (lower bound) and end at `100` (upper bound). The `i` to the right of the "E" tells us what we are summing. In code:

```js
var n = 100
var sum = 0
for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  sum += i
}
```

The result of `sum` is `5050`.

**Tip:** With whole numbers, this particular pattern can be optimized to the following:

```js
var n = 100
var sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
```

Here is another example where the `i`, or the "what to sum", is different:

![sum2](img/sigma2.png)

In code:

```js
var n = 4
var sum = 0
for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  sum += (2 * i + 1)
}
```

The notation can be nested, which is much like nesting a `for` loop. You should evaluate the right-most sigma first, unless the author has enclosed them in parentheses to alter the order. 

![sigma3](img/sigma3.png)

In code:

```js
var sum = 0
for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  for (var j = 4; j <= 6; j++) {
    sum += (3 * i * j)
  }
}
```

Here, `sum` will be `135`.

### capital Pi

The capital Pi or "Big Pi" is very similar to [Sigma](#sigma), except we are using multiplication to find the "products of sequences." 

Take the following:

![capitalPi](img/capital-pi1.png)

In code, it might look like this:

```js
var n = 6
var value = 1
for (var i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
  value *= i
}
```

Where `value` will evaluate to `720`.

## pipes

Pipes can mean different things depending on the context. Below are three common forms.

#### absolute 

![pipes1](img/pipes1.png)

For a number *x*, `| x |` means the absolute of *x*. In code:

```js
var x = -5
var result = Math.abs(x)
// => 5
```

#### euclidean norm

![pipes2](img/pipes2.png)

For a vector *v*, `| v |` means the [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_%28mathematics%29#Euclidean_norm) of *v*. It is also referred to as the "magnitude" or "length" of a vector.

Sometimes this is represented by double-pipes to avoid ambiguity with *absolute* notation. For example:

![pipes4](img/pipes4.png)

Here is an example using an `[x, y, z]` array to represent a 3D vector.

```js
var v = [ 0, 4, -3 ]
length(v)
//=> 5
```

The `length` function:

```js
function length (a) {
  var x = a[0],
      y = a[1],
      z = a[2]
  return Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)
}
```

#### determinant

![pipes3](img/pipes3.png)

For a matrix *A*, `| A |` means the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of matrix *A*.

Here is an example computing the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, represented by a flat array in column-major format.

```js
var determinant = require('gl-mat4/determinant')

var matrix = [1, 0, 0, 1]
var det = determinant(matrix)
//=> 1
```

- [robust-determinant-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robust-determinant-2) and [robust-determinant-3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/robust-determinant-3), specifically for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, respectively

#### hat

The "hat" symbol above a character is used to represent a [unit vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_vector). For example, here is the unit vector of *a*:

![hat](img/hat.png)

In cartesian space, a unit vector is typically length 1, in the range of -1.0 to 1.0. Often we refer to this as *normalizing* a vector.

```js
var a = [0, 4, -3]
normalize(a)
//=> [ 0, 0.8, -0.6000000000000001 ]
```

Notice, since we are working with floating point values and not using numerically robust operations, we do not get a perfect `-(3/5)` value for the Z component.

Here is the `normalize` function, operating on 3D vectors:

```js
function normalize(a) {
    var x = a[0],
        y = a[1],
        z = a[2]
    var len = x*x + y*y + z*z
    if (len > 0) {
        len = 1 / Math.sqrt(len)
        a[0] = a[0] * len
        a[1] = a[1] * len
        a[2] = a[2] * len
    }
    return a
}
```
